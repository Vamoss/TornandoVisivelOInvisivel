# ofxQTVideoSaver #
A wrapper for the QuickTime API for saving movies in the mov format.

## Gotchas  
    YOU MUST COMPILE AND LINK AGAINST THE 10.6 (or earlier) SDK on OS
    X. This will not compile against the 10.7 Lion SDK.

## Compatability ##
    Any platform that runs QuickTime (i.e. Windows, OS X).
    OF 007 : source and example code
    OF 0062: source and example-simple. example-frameBufferObject relies
                on core functionality of 007, but could be replaced by
                ofxFrameBufferObject (if you can find it).

## Attributions ##
James Hughes wrote the example projects, but has no idea where the
rest of this code came from. It was pulled off the openframeworks
forums a long time ago.

I believe the original code is the work of Zach Lieberman, but feel
free to drop me a note if that's not correct.
